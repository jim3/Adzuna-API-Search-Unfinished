`Adzuna Jobs API Search :: Unfinished`

An unfinished, weekend project..mostly a learning exercise in order to learn how other API's work...I used
the [Adzuna API](https://developer.adzuna.com), which I think is a pretty useful and *free* jobs API. 

I *might* come back to it later...in a nutshell, you put in  your desired max. salary and it'll give 
you a list of those jobs *under* that max. salary range. The location is hardcoded for my area but you 
can adjust it via the `distance=${max-salary}` variable...but again, unfinished..have another more important project so....
